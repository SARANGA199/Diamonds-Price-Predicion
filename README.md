# Diamonds-Price-Prediction

### This project leverages machine learning to predict diamond prices based on various features such as carat, cut, clarity, color. The goal is to develop a highly accurate model using multiple techniques and provide a user-friendly interface for predictions.

# Project Workflow

### Data Preprocessing

  Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing features. </br>
  Feature engineering includes encoding categorical variables (e.g., cut, clarity) and scaling numeric ones (e.g., carat). </br>

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  Visualize data distributions and correlations between features using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. </br>
  Key insights include relationships between carat and price, cut and price. </br> 
  Outlier detection is implemented to improve model accuracy. </br>

### Model Selection:

  Several machine learning models are implemented </br>
  Linear Regression: Provides a baseline model using simple linear relationships between features and price. </br>
  Decision Tree Regressor: Captures non-linear relationships between features. </br>
  Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble method that improves prediction performance by averaging multiple decision trees. </br>
  XGBoost: Optimized gradient boosting algorithm used for further refinement. </br>


### Evaluation & Model Tuning

  Models are evaluated using metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and RÂ² scores. </br>
  Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are applied to optimize model performance.

### Deployment

  A web application built with Flask allows users to input diamond characteristics and get instant price predictions. </br>
  Deployed using a simple UI to facilitate easy interaction with the trained machine learning models.
